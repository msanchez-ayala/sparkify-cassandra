# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

Fictional music streaming startup Sparkify wants to analyze their streaming data
on songs and user activity, particularly what songs users are listening to.
Their data is initially stored in CSV files on user activity.

I create the following to help them out:

- An Apache Cassandra database that optimizes Sparkify's querying of song play
data.
- An ETL pipeline to transfer data from the CSV files into Cassandra using
Python and CQL.
